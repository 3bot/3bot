# 3bot

3bot is an open-source software platform to build, configure and perform.
To «perform» is the general term for remote executing tasks by running workflows.
These could be configuration management (CM), continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD) or application deployment 
tasks but also allows you to re-use your shell scripts in a fast and efficient way from a central point.
